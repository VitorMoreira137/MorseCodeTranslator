morse_code_text = """Morse Code is a communication system created by Samuel Morse in 1837.
It was designed to be a fast and practical means of communication through electric telegraphs, 
where messages were transmitted using electrical pulses.

In Morse Code, letters and numbers are translated into sequences of dots (•) and dashes (─).

The universal distress signal, SOS, is represented in Morse Code by three dots, three dashes, and three dots again (... --- ...).

Dots are also called "dit," which corresponds to the sound produced by the electrical pulse that generates this symbol.
 
Dashes, on the other hand, are called "dah."

Each pulse has a specific duration, making it possible to translate and understand messages sent in Morse Code.

### Elements of Morse Code:
Morse Code consists of five elements:

- Dots, or "dit" (•), represented by a short signal (one unit);
- Dashes, or "dah" (─), represented by a long signal (three units);
- A short pause between characters, which lasts as long as a dot;
- A medium pause between words, which lasts as long as three dots;
- A long pause between sentences, which lasts as long as seven dots.

- White spaces are represented as "/".



>> INSTRUCTIONS <<<

➔ The white text box is where you will type your text.
➔ Click the "Translate" Button to translate to morse code.
➔ The morse code will apeear in the grey box.
➔ Use "Play Sound" Button to play the morse code and see the LED blinks in sync with the sound.
➔ The "Play Sound" Button will be clickable, only when there is a morse code in the grey box.
➔ If you want to translate morse code to plain text, click in the "Toggle Translation" switch.

REMEMBER: When using the translator as Morse Code to plan text, 
put spaces between morse elements, otherwise teh output will be incorrect.
